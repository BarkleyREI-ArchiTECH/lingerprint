# How to contribute

## Testing

We should test things,  feel free to do that.

## Submitting changes

Please submit a pull request, along with linked issue that the change addresses.
Please ensure that each PR includes changes for a single issue. 

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."


Thanks
